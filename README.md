# IOT-based-transformer-monitoring
The main aim of this project is distribution transformer monitoring using iot . Many transformers are damaged due to the oil damage. Oil damage is depends on different parameters and environmental conditions. Now in this system we are concentrating on oil level .In this system oil level measurement action is performed based on the ARDUINO UNO microcontroller. After interfacing the required components we developed one application program in embedded-c. Here controller is continuously reading the oil level of transformer and with the help of wifi module ,displaying it on mobile screen.
